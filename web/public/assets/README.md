# MacSnap Setup Files

This package contains all the necessary files to set up your Mac with your selected applications and
configurations.

## Files Included

- **macSnap.sh**: Main setup script that orchestrates the entire installation process
- **Brewfile**: Homebrew package definitions for easy installation
- **customInstall.sh**: Custom installation scripts for specialized software

## Quick Start

1. Extract all files to a directory of your choice
